# StardewValleyCraftingIngredients
Python script for scraping data from https://stardewvalleywiki.com.   
The idea was to find all of the ingredients used on the [Crafting-page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crafting) and list out which ones are used, and in how many crafting recipes.   

The generated output can be found in [Crafting_counts.csv](Crafting_counts.csv).   
Another version that lists out the recipes the ingredient is used in, and their required count is in [Crafting_combined.csv](Crafting_combined.csv).
